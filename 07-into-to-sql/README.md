### Database
- a group of tables
- a place where data lives
- servers, cloud, on your laptop
- software

- Relational Databases (RDBMS) - SQLite, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL - *SQL-like*
- NoSQL - MongoDB (document store), Graph databases (Neo4j), key-value (Redis)

### SQL
- Structured Query Language
  - a language
  - for querying (data)
  - in a structured fashion

- What is the difference between SQL and SQLite3?
  - SQLite3 **is** the database
  - SQL is the language we use to do things with/to the database

## Set Up 

1. Install the SQLite Browser if you haven't already [here](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
2. Open the SQLite Browser and click 'File -> Open DataBase'
3. Choose the `chinook.db` file from this repo. This database is open source and maintained by Microsoft (SQL is no fun if you don't have any data)
4. Click the tab that says 'Execute SQL'. Type SQL queries in the box above. Press the play button. See the results of that query in the box below

## Challenges

1. Write the SQL to return all of the rows in the artists table?

```sql
SELECT *
FROM artists;
```

2. Write the SQL to select the artist with the name "Black Sabbath"

```sql
SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
WHERE name = "Black Sabbath";
```

3. Write the SQL to create a table named 'fans' with an autoincrementing ID that's a primary key and a name field of type text

```sql
CREATE TABLE fans (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);
```

4. Write the SQL to alter the fans table to have an artist_id column type integer?

```sql
ALTER TABLE fans
ADD COLUMN artist_id INTEGER;
```

5. Write the SQL to add yourself as a fan of the Black Eyed Peas? ArtistId **169**

INSERT INTO fans (name, artist_id)
VALUES ("Jason", 169);



6. How would you update your name in the fans table to be your new name?

UPDATE fans SET name= "Jason S" WHERE name= "Jason";

7. Write the SQL to return fans that are not fans of the black eyed peas.

SELECT * FROM fans WHERE artist_id != 169;

8. Write the SQL to change a fan's artist.

UPDATE fans SET artist_id = 11 WHERE name= "Dan";

9. Write the SQL to display an artists name next to their album title

SELECT artists.name, albums.title FROM artists
INNER JOIN albums ON artists.id = albums;

10. Write the SQL to display artist name, album name and number of tracks on that album


SELECT artists.name artist_name, albums.title album_title, COUNT (tracks.id) track_count
FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.id = albums.artist_id
JOIN tracks ON tracks.album_id = albums.id
GROUP BY albums.title;


11. Write the SQL to return the name of all of the artists in the 'Pop' Genre

SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
JOIN albums ON artists.id = albums.artist_id
JOIN tracks ON albums.id = tracks.album_id
JOIN genres ON genres.id = tracks.genre_id
WHERE genres.name = “Pop”
GROUP BY artists.name;


## BONUS (very hard)

12. I want to return the names of the artists and their number of rock tracks
    who play Rock music
    and have move than 30 tracks
    in order of the number of rock tracks that they have
    from greatest to least
